Microbially induced corrosion MIC results in an
unanticipated attack on metals in seemingly benignenvironments and threatens a range of multibillion
dollar industries including aviation surface transportation and
water infrastructure1MIC accounts for 20 40 of the annual
corrosion costs including direct and indirect impacts whichhave been estimated to reach as high as 1 trillion2MIC poses
a signi cantnancial burden in the US alone in the form of
total direct costs 30 50 billionyear3biocide require
ments 12 billionyear4and direct costs in oil and gas
industries 2 billionyear5The US annually spends nearly
6 billion to combat MIC e ects of sulfatereducing bacteria
SRB alone6The SRBs secrete exopolymers on metal surfaces
and form a bio lm to induce uniform corrosion or localized
pitting attack using one or more of the following mechanisms7
i disruption of passivating metaloxide lms ii alteringredox conditions at the metal solution interface iii
regeneration of the electron acceptors iv production of
aggressive metabolites  eg suldes and v depolarizing the
cathodic reactions
Major corrosion mitigation practices including protective
coatings and impressed current cathodic protection tend to fail
under MIC conditions For example commercially availablepolymer coatings  eg epoxy liners are prone to biodegrada
tion and they exhibit poor adhesion toward metals underaqueous conditions
811The thickness of commercial coatings
501000 m can also disrupt the functionality  eg

Recent studies have demonstrated the corrosion resistance of

conditions The graphene coatings exhibit excellent chemical
inertness ductility hydrophobicity impermeability andstrength Screeninglevel life cycle analysis has demonstrated

graphene coatings serve as cathodic sites for capturing and
reducing terminal electron acceptors and simultaneously
aggravating galvanic corrosion of the underlying metals18
Unlike graphene the 2D hexagonal boron nitrided hBN canbe obtained as an insulating coating to suppress the galvanic

highperformance coatings endowed with exceptional properties related to adhesion barrier impermeability and
stability

Gramnegative Escherichia coli 19In this paper we explore the use of a singlelayered hBN
coating as a thinnest insulating barrier to protect metals againstMIC e ects of aggressive sulfatereducing conditions We use
Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 as the model for the SRB and Cu as
a technologically relevant metal This study provides insightinto the performance of 2D hBN coating against the MICeects of the G20 strain in the planktonic and sessile forms
Here we assess and quantify the longterm performance of 2DhBN coating on a temporal scale that re ects Cubio lm

Identifying Inherent Defects in SLhBN We carried out
detailed oxidation experiments to identify the defect density of
SLhBN coatings The results from the oxidation experimentsare summarized here with further details below 1 SLhBN
coatings were able to protect the underlying copper substrates
in oxidizing environments 2 SLhBN coatings are characterized by inherent defects 3 Raman mapping tests
corroborate the speci c degree of surface coverage o ered by
the single layer of hBN coating The oxidation experimentswere carried out by exposing the SLhBNCu and bare Cu to
oxidizing environments induced by air annealing  200C8
h Another set of oxidation experiments was carried out bytreating the samples with 30 H
2O2for2 h The exposure
time determined from preliminary trials ensured aggressive
oxidizing environments without destroying the samples Figure
2ab presents the scanning electron microscopy SEM images
for the oxidized samples at the end of the air annealing
experiments  200C8 h The oxidized surface is shown as
the white layer on the copper substrate red background A
quantitative analysis using ImageJ software revealed that the
percentage of oxidized area for SLhBNCu and bare Cu was30 and 70 respectively Exposure to H
2O2revealed that
SLhBNCu is susceptible to oxidation under aqueous
conditions oxidized surface in green color and una ected
copper in gray color  Figure 2 d The H2O2experiments
revealed that the SLhBNCu and bare Cu were oxidized by45 and 71 respectively  Figure 2 cd These results
indicate that defects due to grain boundaries and uncoalesced
grains measured in terms of the  copper oxidation a ect the
surface coverage o ered by the SLhBN coatings
We carried out additional Raman mapping tests after
transferring the lms of SLhBNCu on SiO 2Si specimens
exposed area 1431 m2Figure 2 e The Raman mapping
results indicate that hBN coatings were characterized with a
coverage area of 88 Considering this situation the
enhanced performance of the hBN coatings  iel o w e r
corrosion rates is attributable to its insulating nature and its
resultant ability to repress galvanic e ects as discussed later
Improving surface coverage is expected to further enhance the
ability of hBN coatings to combat MIC
Crystallographic Orientation of Cu and the E ect on
Defects in SLhBN The hBN lms grown using the CVD
process are prone to intercalation of corrosion molecules due to
the following two factors i defects that develop due todiscontinuous formation of layers in the form of isolated islands
or domains and ii mismatch of copper and hBN orientation
due to polycrystalline copper which introduces di erent
interfaces with hBN allowing ions to intercalate between the
hBNlm and copper substrate2729Based on previous studies
the lowest defect density for hBN growth on copper requiresthe Cu surface to have a 111 direction3031The singlecrystal
orientation of Cu helps to match the hexagonal lattice of hBN
to produce highquality and largescale conformal coating Iteliminates the presence of numerous smallsized grains and
grain boundaries which are sources of coating degradation and

defects and improve the surface coverage of hBN coatings
HighPerformance Nanoscale hBN Coatings for
Microbially Induced Corrosion Resistance Sulfatereduc
ing bacteria represent a diverse group of prokaryotes that are
known to accelerate corrosion of technologically relevantmetals We used D vibrio G20 as the model for Gramnegative
mesophilic SRB to evaluate the MIC resistance of SLhBNcoated Cu using the following three experiments i abioticcontrol ii planktonic cell test G20 cells in suspension andiii bio lm test G20 cells encapsulated in a biological lm
Biotic vs Abiotic Corrosion under Neutral Conditions As
discussed in the Supporting Information Figures S2 and S3
the lactate C media did not exert any corrosive e ects on Cu in
the absence of the G20 strain  ie abiotic conditions For
example the opencircuit potential OCP for the biotic testsshifted to negative values  750 mV vsAgAgCl when
compared to that with abiotic tests 0 mV vsAgAgCl  Figure
S2a The DC tests show that the polarization resistance  R
p
for biotic tests was 67 times lower compared to its abiotic
counterpart  Figure S2b  and corrosion rates  Figure S2c 
were4 times higher The EIS analysis also suggests that the
charge transfer resistance for biotic tests was 6 times lower
when compared to that of the abiotic tests see Bode plots inFigure S3ab  The EIS analysis for the abiotic and biotic tests
indicates di erent sequences of corrosion mechanisms and
dierent electrical equivalent circuit EEC for each case

Planktonic Tests Passivation E ects of SLhBN Coatings
We con rmed the passive nature of SLhBN coating against the
MIC e ects of the planktonic cells in ve dierent ways as
discussed below First we used potentiodynamic polarizationtests to observe the current response of the working electrodeafter sweeping its applied potential away from the OCPconditions The nobler OCP value for the SLhBNCu cell670 mV vsAgAgCl when compared to that of bare copper
735 mV vsAgAgCl supports the passivation property of
the SLhBN coating  Figure 3 a Lower current density in the
anodic branch indicates its higher corrosion resistance  Figure
3a The singlelayered hBN coating limits the corrosion
current to 6 mAcm
2 which is 4fold lower compared to
that of bare Cu  27 mAcm2Figure 3 a The anodic
polarization curve for the bare Cu is dominant at higher appliedpotentials starting from 0 V vsAgAgCl Moreover the
anodic branch for the bare Cu test registers a sharp increase incurrent density at 0 V vsAgAgCl indicating the breakdown
of the passivation lm on the Cu surface and subsequent
copper dissolution In contrast the current density values for
the SLhBNCu remain constant during the entire potential
range con rming its ability to minimize copper dissolution
even at higher potential scans
Second we ran CV tests for the bare Cu and SLhBNCu
cells for four consecutive cycles to investigate the underlyingmechanisms for the Cu corrosion The CV results con rm that
the anodic current observed during the potential polarizationtests is due to Cu oxidation Cu Cu
22e For example
the CV test for the bare Cu cell yielded a sharp increase in the
current density when the potential approached 30 mV with an
oxidation peak at 144 mV vsAgAgCl  Figure 3 b This
oxidation peak can be attributed to Cu dissolution The
reduction peak  40 mV vsAgAgCl during the negative scan
corresponds to the reduction of Cu2ions Figure 3 b provides
the evidence for the ability of the SLhBN coating to suppress
the Cu dissolution The peak anodic current  ipa for the SL
hBN coating  25Acm2i s36 times lower compared to
that of bare Cu  915Acm2 This anodic peak is absent for
the SLhBNCu cell at positive potentials 0 500 mV vsAg
AgCl
Third we used optical imaging to assess the degree of
corrosion attack on the underlying Cu surfaces after four cyclesof the CV runs The CV test represents a destructive
electrochemical test As shown in Figure 3 c the bare Cu
suered a higher degree of debilitation whereas the SLhBN
coated Cu stayed intact even after the four CV runs
Fourth the postmortem analysis revealed that the hBN
coatings minimized the degree of pitting attack on theunderlying Cu surface We cleaned the surfaces of the corroded
specimens  ie after the CV runs with 10 sulfuric acid to
remove remnants of the bio lm and corrosion products The
bare Cu sample was characterized by an extremely rough
surface with an abundant number of micropits throughout the
sample area whereas the surface of the SLhBN sample
remained intact exhibiting only minor surface roughness and
isolated pits  Figure 3 c
Finally EIS analysis was used to discern the protection
mechanism o ered by SLhBN coatings against the planktonic
cells As shown in Figure 3 d the magnitude of the Nyquist arc
ie polarization resistance  R
p in the SLhBNCu cell is 3
fold higher than that of the bare Cu cell The EEC tting

Biolm Tests Microbial Corrosion Resistance of the SL
hBN Coatings We used the linear polarization resistance
method to investigate the e ectiveness of the hBN coatings
against MIC of the bio lm At the end of day 24 the Rpoered
by the SLhBN coating  20463cm2 was 9 times higher
than that of bare Cu  2373cm2Figure 4 aFigure 4 b
shows that the MIC rates in the SLhBN cell were 67 lower
on day 1 82 lower on day 15 and 87 lower on day 24
The lower corrosion rates suggest the ability to minimize the
corrosion attack on the Cu surfaces The corrosion current

Barrier Properties of hBN Coatings We used the EIS
test as a nonintrusive method for elucidating the reasons for theMIC resistance of the SLhBN coatings against e ects of the
G20 bio lm The hBN coatings exert a dominant electro
chemical polarization resistance to underlying corrosionprocesses relative to the bare Cu cell  Figure 4 c The EECanalysis con rms that the corrosion resistance  R

that by the bare Cu cell  253 kcm2Table S2  The value

contacting the Cu surface  Table S2 13The value of Cpofor
SLhBN surface coating is an order of magnitude lower thanthat of bare Cu The value of C

The optical evidence further corroborates the barrier properties
of the hBN coatings against the MIC e ects of the bio lm
Figure 5  Both the bare Cu and SLhBNCu surface
developed identical bio lm properties related to uniformity
and thicknesses  Figure 5 ac However the bare Cu surface
was characterized by an apparent layer of black corrosiondeposits  Figure 5 a whereas the SLhBNCu surface remained
clean even after 24 days of the MIC experiment  Figure 5 c
Further the underlying bare Cu surface su ered from localized
attack by aggressive SRB metabolites  eg organic acids and
H
2S whereas the SLhBNCu specimen faced only a minimal
degree of pitting  Figure 5 bd As discussed below the Xray
diraction XRD results con rm that the SLhBN coating
remained intact until the end of the MIC experiment The SLhBNcoated Cu has also experienced a slight increase in thecorrosion rates during the linear polarization resistance testsFigure 4 ab which is attributed to the defects in the CVD
coated hBN coatings Based on the ratio of R
ctvalues for the
bare Cu and SLhBNCu12the percentage of the uncoated area
on the SLhBNCu surface was estimated to be 9
These ndings demonstrate that the impermeable nature of
the SLhBN coating prevents the sulfate reducing bacteria and
its aggressive metabolic products acids HS from contacting
the underlying Cu surface The pore size of the 2D hBN 60pm36is smaller than the e ective ionic radii  r of a range of
participating redox species such as Cu2r 73 pm and Cur
 77 pm19aggressive metabolites such as HSr 207

sections of this paper the MIC resistance of the hBN coating is
also attributed to its insulating characteristics that disable thecathodic reactions  eg proton reduction and the subsequent
galvanic e ects
Signatures of Microbial Corrosion At the end of the
MIC experiments the corroded specimens were subjected to
visual tests and a series of SEM energydispersive spectroscopy
EDS and XRD examinations to investigate the signatures ofthe MIC attack Both the bare Cu and SLhBNCu electrodeswere characterized by thick and homogeneous bio lms of rod
shaped cells that is a typical characteristic of the D alaskensis
G20 strain  Figure 6 ab The visual tests revealed dominant
darkgray crystals in corrosion deposits representing chalcociteCu
2S which is a signature of the MIC attack on Cu
surfaces74041The EDS analysis of the bare Cu and SLhBN
Cu surface shows the peaks for sulfur along with other elementsincluding C Cu O and P  Figure 6 cd We attribute the O
and C peaks to the carboxy C O and CO components of
extracellular polymeric EPS bio lm7The Xray di ractogram
of the bare Cu surface con rmed the presence of chalcocite
crystals  Figure 6 e The D alaskensis G20 strain also aids in
formation of chalcocite and EPS compounds to develop adefensive barrier against Cu toxicity7The SLhBNCu exhibits
a poor signal for the C peak The intensity of the chalcolitepeak for the SLhBNCu surface is also 3 orders of magnitudelower compared to that of the bare Cu  Figure 6 f These
results suggest that D alaskensis G20 uses copper as the
electron donor  eq 4 and the sulfate or proton as the electron

In light of the dissimilatory reduction mechanisms the
following results con rm that the SLhBN coating decelerates
the metabolic activity of SRB associated production of biogenicsulde and subsequent MIC attack by D alaskensis G20 The
highperformance liquid chromatography HPLC analysisconrms the role of hBN coatings in suppressing the metabolic
activities The electrolyte in the SLhBNCu cell registered 2
fold lower values for the organic acids acetic acid andpropionic acid when compared to the bare Cu cell  Figure
S5a The SLhBNCu cell has also registered lower values for
sulde HS
 concentration throughout the temporal scale
Figure S5b  For example the HSconcentration for the SL
hBNCu cell on day 7  63gL was 14fold lower than
that of the bare Cu cell  88gL The rate of increase in the
pH for the SLhBNCu cell 72 to 78 was also lower than
that of the bare Cu cell 73 to 82  Figure S5c  The lower

Galvanic Corrosion E ects of hBN Coatings Com
pared with Those of Graphene and Bare CopperGalvanic corrosion occurs when two dissimilar metals arecoupled in a corrosive electrolyte The metal with more positivepotential in a galvanic series will act as a cathode and the metalwith negative potential acts as an anode Corrosion occurs atthe interface of such galvanic couples A coating such asgraphene graphite has more noble potential compared tocopper in a galvanic series
45A small defect such as pinhole
cracks or scratches in graphene coating will expose a smallanode Cu to large cathode graphene leading to a largeanodic current so as to balance the electron requirement of thecathodic site The areas with even such minor coating defectsare prone to localized corrosion which will create a ripple e ect
propagating it to other sites in the metal surface In fact recentstudies on galvanic e ects of graphene described that grain
boundary defects in graphene coatings will accelerate localizedcorrosion by forming galvanic couples

To study and compare the galvanic e ects of graphene and
hBN coatings with bare copper we carried out galvanic
corrosion tests using the ASTM G 7181 standards These tests
were carried out by con guring the Gamry potentiostat in a

by procedure ASTM G102
KI
corrosion rate mpyEW1g
where K1is the Faraday constant 01288 mpy Igis galvanic
corrosion density in Acm2 EW is the equivalent weight of
copper 317 and is copper density 894 gcm3
The signi cantly higher galvanic corrosion rates in the case of
CuSLG clearly demonstrates that graphene coating on copperleads to galvanic problems The electrode potential from thegalvanic couples can be used to determine the higher 
cathodic nature of the metal
45The more positive the value of
potential in the galvanic couple the higher its cathodic natureFrom Figure 8 b galvanic potential of CuSLG is higher  744
mV than that of CuSLhBN  792 mV which we expect is
related to the di erences in electrical conductivity of SLG and
SLhBN Moreover the galvanic potential of SLhBN iscomparable to that of an insulating SiO
2Si surface  Figure
8b Since graphene acts more cathodic when coupled to
copper than hBN CuSLG couple generates higher anodiccurrent leading to greater extent of galvanic corrosion This isthe reason why SLhBN coatings reduce the galvanic corrosioneects by 400 times when compared to SLG coatings as
revealed in our experiments It should be noted that theelectron mobility of hBN  4923 cm
2Vs49is154fold
lower than that of copper  32 cm2Vs50and40 times
lower than that in graphene  2105cm2Vs51The
insulating behavior of hBN is due to the di erences in
electronegativity between the boron and nitrogen atoms whichresults in localization of electrons around the nitrogen
atoms52
CONCLUSION
This study demonstrates the ability of singlelayered hBN topassivate the negative e ects of microbially induced corrosion
It is the thinnest insulating coating that combats the corrodingeects of the aggressive metabolites generated by the
dissimilatory sulfate reduction process The MIC resistance ofthe singlelayered hBN coating emerges from the combinedeects of its impermeable nature barrier for electron acceptors
redox species and biogenic chemicals and insulating characteristics suppresses cathodic reduction and galvanic e ects
METHODS
A complete description of the experimental procedures can be found
in the Supporting Information  and only a brief account is given below
The copper foils were coated with singlelayer hexagonal boron nitride
CVD2X1BN 20 m thick Graphene Supermarket viachemical
vapor deposition using the earlier procedures de ned in the
literature5354D alaskensis was anaerobically grown in the lactate C
medium using the procedures described previously5556Microbial
corrosion experiments were carried out in a 400 mL single
compartment corrosion cell consisting of three electrodes a graphiteplate as a counter electrode a AgAgCl as a reference electrode and a
working electrode area of 1 cm
2 We carried out abiotic tests
planktonic cell tests and bio lm tests as described in the Supporting
Information 
Cyclic voltammetry linear polarization resistance potentiodynamic
polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used
to analyze the resistance of the coatings against MIC conditions The
procedures reported previously57were used to transfer the SLhBN
coatings from an underlying copper foil to the SiO 2Si substrate The
samples were analyzed using SEM TEM XRD and Raman
spectroscopy To determine the organic inorganic anions and
metal ions we collected the samples of the electrolyte from the test
cells periodically using a sterile syringe lter with a pore diameter of
02m Concentration of organic acids lactic acetic and propionic
acid was determined using a Shimadzu HPLC equipped with an
Aminex HPX87H column 300 mm 78 mm dimension an SPD
10A UV vis detector and 0005 M H 2SO4as the mobile phase
Concentration of aqueous sul de was determined using a spectropho
tometer following the USEPA methylene blue method58The pH of
the electrolyte samples was measured using an Orion Star Benchtop
pH meter
